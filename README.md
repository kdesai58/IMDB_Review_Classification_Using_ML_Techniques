This dataset is taken from kaggle. The likk is 'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews'.

Dataset Details:-
  IMDB dataset having 50K movie reviews for natural language processing or Text analytics.
This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets. We provide a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training and 25,000 for testing. So, predict the number of positive and negative reviews using either classification or deep learning algorithms.

Model Implementaion:- 
  I used the ML techniques of NLP like tokenaizing, lemmatizing, word2vec, Avgword2vec for Data preproccessing and Data Engineering.
  For the classification models, I choose RandomForest, SGD and XGBoost. I also use the VotingClassifer to get the best predection from that three models.
